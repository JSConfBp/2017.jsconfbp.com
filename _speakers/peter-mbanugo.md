In the last 10 years the number of internet users has grown from 1,162,916,818 to 3,424,971,237, and by 2017, many more are expected to come online from less developed nations. These nations lack fast internet speed and, for most, internet data is expensive. People from these nations will occupy a large percentage of our user base, and as developers, are we prepared to serve them? Have we thought of how our apps will respond in scenarios of poor or no connection, or how users will react if it consumes too much data? In this talk, I'll tell you from my own experience as a citizen of an emerging nation (Nigeria) about these users, some constraints we face, how we can build apps with better experience for them, and principles I think if followed, will make our apps work for the next billion internet users.
