To help developer communities out there, we start our Ambassador Program!  
**We provide a â‚¬50 discount coupon code for every community, who applies.**

For **every 5 ticket** sold with this coupon code, we provide a **free ticket for the community** who applied for the coupon, this free ticket then can be awarded to a community/meetup/usergroup member, or make it as a prize in a contest, it's up to the awarded group.

If you organize a meetup or usergroup, apply here:
