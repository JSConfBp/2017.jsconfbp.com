Our very first batch of tickets will be available for sale from **19th June, 14:00 CEST.**
Follow us on twitter for the exact announcement!

Just as we did last year, we would like to put together a budget, for our upcoming [Diversity Sponsorship program](http://jsconfbp.com/diversity-sponsorship). This budget will be formed from financial support by companies, and sponsorship-valued tickets.

Sponsorship-valued tickets contain a portion of a sponsored ticket, for example, if you buy an Early Bird + 50% Diversity support ticket, you sponsored 50% of someone’s ticket who’s in need.

The tickets will be available at these prices:

**Early Bird tickets**  
100 EUR + VAT + Fees = 133 EUR

**Early Bird tickets + 25% Diversity support**  
100 + 25 EUR + VAT + Fees = 166 EUR

**Early Bird tickets + 50% Diversity support**  
100 + 50 EUR + VAT + Fees = 199 EUR

**Early Bird tickets + 100% Diversity support**  
100 + 100 EUR + VAT + Fees = 266 EUR
