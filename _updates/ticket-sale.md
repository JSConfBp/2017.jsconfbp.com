Just as we did last year, we would like to put together a budget, for our upcoming [Diversity Sponsorship program](http://jsconfbp.com/diversity-sponsorship). This budget will be formed from financial support by companies, and sponsorship-valued tickets.

Sponsorship-valued tickets contain a portion of a sponsored ticket, for example, if you buy a Regular + 50% Diversity support ticket, you sponsored 50% of someone’s ticket who’s in need.

The tickets will be available at these prices:

**Regular tickets**  
210 EUR + VAT + Fees = 277 EUR

**Regular tickets + 25% Diversity support**  
210 + 52 EUR + VAT + Fees = 346 EUR

**Regular tickets + 50% Diversity support**  
210 + 105 EUR + VAT + Fees = 415 EUR

**Regular tickets + 100% Diversity support**  
210 + 210 EUR + VAT + Fees = 555 EUR

### Discount Coupons

On 26th June, we start our Ambassador Program, which is aimed to help developer communities to get a 50 EUR discount from the tickets.

Stay tuned for more updates!
